# Neovim

![](./screenshot.png)

"Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more."
You can find more information about it [here](https://neovim.io)


The configuration is organized in 4 parts:

* **GENERAL** - General configurations of the editor like encoding, undo levels, etc.
* **FORMATING / CODING** - Code editing configurations like indentation, line numbers, etc.
* **PLUGINS** - List of plugins and its respective configurations.
* **UI** - UI definitions like removing menus, highlight long lines, colorscheme, etc.

### Installation

All information can be found [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim), just remember to install with Python support, to be able to use [Ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips), and some other plugins .

### Plugin manager

In this configuration, I used [Vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager.
To install:
```bash
